# enterprise-showcase

Showcase all the great work that your peers are working on and happily sharing internally. 

`enterprise-showcase` is a static web site, hosted on *GitHub Pages* and generated through *GitHub Actions*. No need for a separate runtime or server, and you can fine tune how often you want the site to be generated. 

## Features
- Browse every `internal` repository across all organizations of your GitHub Enterpise Account. 
- Create collections of repositories so that you can highlight great projects. 
- Easily extended so you can customize it to your needs

`enterprise-showcase` is built with GitHub Pages, GitHub Actions, [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/)


## Setup
- Fork the following repository (like we did for this project): https://github.com/helaili/enterprise-showcase

- Enable GitHub Pages by setting `gh-pages` as the source branch

- Create a `GH_EA_TOKEN` secret and provide a Personal Access Token with `read:org` and `read:enterprise` permissions as the value (see [helaili/ea-repo-list](https://github.com/helaili/ea-repo-list) for more details). 
- Configure the repository retrieval job by editing the `.github\workflows\repo-list.yml` and provide the name of your GitHub Enterprise Account

```yaml

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Get the repos
      uses: helaili/ea-repo-list@master
      with:
        enterprise: <replace with GitHub Enteprise Account name>
        outputFilename: repositories.json
        token: ${{secrets.GH_EA_TOKEN}}
```
- Manually trigger a first repository list retrieval by starting the *Generate repository list* workflow. The Actions workflow should execute succesfully and you should get a freshly commited `repositories.json` file at the root of your repository.

- Create collections by creating a `.md` file per collection in `content/collections`. The *front matter* header allow you to set the collection title, description and list of repositories. The body of the document is available to provide a more detailed description of the collection.

```markdown

title: C.R.E.A.M.
description: Cheese Rules Everything Around Me
repositories:
- octocheese/camembert
- octocheese/roquefort
- amsterdam/gouda
- vermont/cheddar

# All of them!!!

```

- The web site should be published to `https://<your org or account name>/enterprise-showcase/`. In case you renamed the repository, change `router.base` accordingly in the `nuxt.config.js` file. Remove this variable completely if you are publishing to your organization or account-level site (`<user>.github.io` or `<organization>.github.io`)

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
